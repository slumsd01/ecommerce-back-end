![ecommerce-back-end-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90315740/150962659-202b5f1e-ab0f-40ac-a38d-afa4b197c464.jpg)

## Description
This project was made as part of an e-commerce website. The front-end design is not yet completed, but the back-end database with API routes has been prepared here, so the transition to a full website should be fairly smooth! The database includes tables to track individual product information, like price and stock, as well other attributes including categories and relevant tags.

## Installation
This application was built using basic Javascript, and the npms listed below. MYSQL Workbench was also used for ease of testing and querying the database, though it is not required.

Required npms:
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
- [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (Optional - to protect sensitive information)

## Usage
To access the program via `localhost`, a connection to the server must be made using MYSQL. After installing the necessary npms and providing the database access criteria, the connection can be made using the terminal CLI by evoking `npm start`.
